# Enable Gmail API: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/gmail.googleapis.com

# Make sure OAuth is enabled: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent

# When running, it will open a browser and ask for permission to access your account
# Since the app is not verified, it is normal to get a "Google hasnâ€™t verified this app" message
# Just dismiss it and give permissions
